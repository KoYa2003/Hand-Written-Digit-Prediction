# Hand-Written-Digit-Prediction

The goal of this project is to develop a highly accurate machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits (0-9). This model should achieve high precision and recall, generalize well to new data, avoid overfitting, and be suitable for deployment in real-world applications like optical character recognition (OCR) systems.
